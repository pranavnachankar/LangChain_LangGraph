Significant disparities exist across urban vs. rural areas, a concerningly low female labor force participation rate, and higher unemployment among educated youth. The informal sector dominates employment, often with poor working conditions and underemployment.\n",

Poor infrastructure, low agricultural productivity, and social norms hindering women's participation also contribute significantly.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Socio-Economic Impacts:** Unemployment leads to poverty, inequality, social unrest, brain drain, and underutilization of human capital. It also causes mental health issues for individuals and reduces overall economic demand and tax revenue for the government.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Government Initiatives & Way Forward:** The government has launched various schemes like Skill India, Make in India, MGNREGA, and Start-up India to address unemployment. However, challenges like jobless growth and job quality remain. Recommendations include comprehensive education reform, boosting manufacturing, promoting entrepreneurship, strengthening the rural economy, addressing gender disparity, and investing in research and green jobs.\n"
